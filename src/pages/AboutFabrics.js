The warp yarns are taped in groups of tightly woven filling yarns, which have been beaten in very closely. After weaving, the fabric is cut into strips between the yarn groups. Each cutting produces a continuous chenille yarn, which is then twisted, creating the chenille yarn, and giving the pile appearance on all sides of the yarn.

                <h3>Melton</h3>
                <p>A heavyweight, dense, compacted, and tightly woven wool or wool blend fabric used mainly for coats. </p>
                <h3>Merino</h3>
                <p>A type of wool that originates from purebred Merino sheep. The best Merino wool comes from Italy.</p>
                <h3>Mesh</h3>
                <p>A type of fabric characterised by its net-like open appearance, and the spaces between the yarns. Mesh is available in a variety of constructions including woven, knits, laces, or crocheted fabrics. </p>
                <h3>Metallic Fibre</h3>
                <p>An inorganic fibre made from minerals and metals, blended and extruded to form fibres. The fibre is formed from a flat ribbon of metal, coated with a protective layer of plastic, which reduces tarnishing. Metal used in apparel fabric is purely decorative.</p>
                <h3>Microfibres</h3>
                <p>The name given to ultra-fine manufactured fibres and the name given to the technology of developing these fibres. Fibres made using microfibre technology, produce fibres which weigh less than 1.0 denier. The fabrics made from these extra-fine fibres provide a superior hand, a gentle drape, and incredible softness. Comparatively, microfibres are two times finer than silk, three times finer than cotton, eight times finer than wool, and one hundred times finer than a human hair. Currently, there are four types of microfibres being produced. These include acrylic microfibres, nylon microfibres, polyester microfibres, and rayon microfibres.</p>
                <h3>Micron</h3>
                <p>A unit of measure that describes the average staple fibre diameter in a lot of wool. Over the past 30 years, the Micron measurement has evolved to become the predominant term used commercially to describe the fineness of a wool fibre. A Micron is determined by the actual measurement when the wool lots are tested for sale during wool processing. Most wool fibres range in the area of 18-40 micron. Merino wool falls into the 18-24 micron range. The 25-32 micron, medium range wool, is usually defined by the word "Shetland", and is used in such applications as blankets and knitwear apparel. The 33-40 range Micron usually describes the wool most often used in the carpet industry.</p>
                <h3>Modal</h3>
                <p>Made from spun Beechwood cellulose, the bio-based fibres create textiles that do not fibrillate, or pill, and are resilient to shrinking and fading.</p>
                <h3>Mohair</h3>
                <p>A fabric obtained from yarn made from the silky hair of the Angora goat.</p>
                <h3>Moiré</h3>
                <p>A corded fabric, usually made from silk or one of the manufactured fibres, which has a distinctive water-marked wavy pattern on the face of the fabric.</p>
                <h3>Muslin</h3>
                <p>An inexpensive, medium weight, plain weave, low count (less than 160 threads per square inch) cotton sheeting fabric. In its unfinished form, it is commonly used in fashion design to make trial garments for preliminary fit.</p>
