The warp yarns are taped in groups of tightly woven filling yarns, which have been beaten in very closely. After weaving, the fabric is cut into strips between the yarn groups. Each cutting produces a continuous chenille yarn, which is then twisted, creating the chenille yarn, and giving the pile appearance on all sides of the yarn.

                <h3>Merino</h3>

                <h3>Mesh</h3>

                <h3>Metallic Fibre</h3>
                <p>An inorganic fibre made from minerals and metals, blended and extruded to form fibres. The fibre is formed from a flat ribbon of metal, coated with a protective layer of plastic, which reduces tarnishing. Metal used in apparel fabric is purely decorative.</p>
                <h3>Microfibres</h3>
                <p>The name given to ultra-fine manufactured fibres and the name given to the technology of developing these fibres. Fibres made using microfibre technology, produce fibres which weigh less than 1.0 denier. The fabrics made from these extra-fine fibres provide a superior hand, a gentle drape, and incredible softness. Comparatively, microfibres are two times finer than silk, three times finer than cotton, eight times finer than wool, and one hundred times finer than a human hair. Currently, there are four types of microfibres being produced. These include acrylic microfibres, nylon microfibres, polyester microfibres, and rayon microfibres.</p>
                <h3>Micron</h3>
                <p>A unit of measure that describes the average staple fibre diameter in a lot of wool. Over the past 30 years, the Micron measurement has evolved to become the predominant term used commercially to describe the fineness of a wool fibre. A Micron is determined by the actual measurement when the wool lots are tested for sale during wool processing. Most wool fibres range in the area of 18-40 micron. Merino wool falls into the 18-24 micron range. The 25-32 micron, medium range wool, is usually defined by the word "Shetland", and is used in such applications as blankets and knitwear apparel. The 33-40 range Micron usually describes the wool most often used in the carpet industry.</p>

                <h3>Twist</h3>
                <p>A term that applies to the number of turns and the direction that two yarns are turned during the manufacturing process. The yarn twist brings the fibres close together and makes them compact. It helps the fibres adhere to one another, increasing yarn strength. The direction and amount of yarn twist helps determine appearance, performance, durability of both yarns and the subsequent fabric or textile product. Single yarns may be twisted to the right (S twist) or to the left (Z twist). Generally, woollen and worsted yarns are S-twist, while cotton and flax yarns are typically Z-twist. Twist is generally expressed as turns per inch (tpi), turns per meter (tpm), or turns per centimetre (tpc).</p>

                <p>A term applied to fabrics whose pores have been closed, and therefore, will not allow water or air to pass through them.</p>
                <h3>Water Repellent</h3>
                <p>A term applied to fabrics that have been treated with a finish which causes them to shed water, but are still air-permeable.</p>
                <h3>Weft</h3>
                <p>In woven fabric, the filling yarns that run perpendicular to the warp yarns.</p>
                <h3>Wool</h3>
