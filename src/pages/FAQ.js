                <h3>Do you supply samples?</h3>
                <p>Benjamin Woollens supplies samples for most of our fabrics.
                A sample has a minimal charge of R50,00. A sample is a small cutting of the fabric and may vary in size (usually at least 8cm x 5cm minimum, depending on the value of the fabric).
                A sample will give a true representation of colour, texture, pattern, weight and handle of a fabric. The charge is to cover the time and manpower needed to locate the fabrics within our vast inventory and therefore fulfil the many requests for samples received daily.
                    Alternatively, please feel free to visit the Benjamin Woollens Showroom where one of our experienced sales professionals will happily provide you with a maximum of 10 samples free of charge - please note this only applies to local customers. For international sample requests, please contact customer service.</p>
